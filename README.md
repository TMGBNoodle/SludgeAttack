Name : Sludge Attack

  This game is intended to create a scenario where the player must clean up moving and rapidly multiplying blobs of sludge as 
  quickly as possible in order to encourage enviormental awareness and cleanup. 

  The narrative of this game is that your friendly neighborhood rat, who has not been mutated by radiation at all, has 
  informed you that sludge has begun leaking all across your home. It is your job to clean it up as much as possible. 

  Game mechanics include player character movement, a dash mechanic which allows the character to roll short distancecs, 
  and a broom, which is controlled by the players mouse and will clean sludge blobs on contact. Additionally, there is a 
  stamina bar, which drains with every dash. Drinking coffee by pressing E will refill the stamina bar and trigger dialogue. 
  Pressing E while near the rat will also trigger dialogue. Sounds are made when dashing or when sludge has been cleaned. 

  This game features a mostly "wild-west" asthetic. The green sludge is meant to resemble radioactive waste, with green 
  particle effects floating around it. Objects the player is able to interact with emmit a golden light to draw the 
  players attention. 

  Desiging the map and the sound effects was interesting and enjoyable. It was a struggle to create properly working particle effects and lighting.

Mason designed the map and texture assets while adding the npc dialogue and lighting effects. He also found and implemented the sound effects. 
Meanwhile, Tucker implemented the player character and all of it's components, including the dash effect. He also created the sludge blobs, implementing their spawn and movement systems along with their particle effects.
He also set up the stamina bar and the coffee buff that replenishes it when interacted with.
